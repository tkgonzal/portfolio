            <h1>A Few of my Most Favourite Things</h1>
            <p className="interests--blurb">
                I'm a worldly guy with some worldly tastes. Take a quick
                peep at some things I like.

            <h2 className="interests--header">Music</h2>
            <p className="interests--blurb">
                Music is probably the thing I'm most invested in. I try to
                listen to a lot of music but my favourite genres are Hip-Hop 
                and Midwest Emo. Some of my favourite artists include JPEGMAFIA,
                mom jeans., 100 Gecs, and D'Angelo.

            <h2 className="interests--header">Art</h2>
            <p className="interests--blurb">
                In my free time I'm a hobby artist, though nowadays I tend to 
                appreciate art more often than make it. Here's a very minimal
                gallery of pieces I've made.

            <h2 className="interests--header">Custom Keyboards</h2>
            <p className="interests--blurb">
                During the pandemic, I got into the hobby of custom mechanical
                keyboards because I didn't have enough expensive hobbies to 
                drain my wallet. I've built quite a few boards since getting 
                into the hobby but my current daily driver is a:

            <h2 className="interests--header">Games</h2>
            <p className="interests--blurb">
                Games are arguably the reason I became interested in
                Computer Science in the first place. Some of my favourite
                video games include Persona 3 Portable, Mother 3, and
                Undertale. Haven't had the time to play video games 
                much as of late, but this year I've recently gotten into
                and have been obssessed with the TTRPG Pathfinder 2e.
