                Welcome to my home grown, farm to table, DIY portfolio site.
                Take a look around to learn more about me and some of the 
                programming work I've done.

                This site's aesthetic is largely inspired by the Y2K aesthetic,
                namely how sites were designed around that time. I have a fondness
                for the style, so this portfolio is my attempt at trying to 
                achieve that look using modern front end techniques, namely
                with React and React-Router.
