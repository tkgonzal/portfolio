    "Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?",
    "Slip like Freudian, Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordian",
    "The ocean washed open your grave",
    "These sweet instincts, ruin my life",
    "Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?",
    "Believe it or not, you won't find it so hot, if you ain't got the do-re-mi!",
    "Don't rely on the strength of my image",
    "Is you goin' finished what you started, what you quittin' for?",
    "The city never lets me down!"
