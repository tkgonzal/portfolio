    "Why can't I see the sunspots in your eyes?",
    "Slip like Freudian, Your first and last step to playing yourself like accordian",
    "The ocean washed open your grave",
    "These sweet instincts, ruin my life",
    "Believe it or not, you won't find it so hot, if you ain't got the do-re-mi!",
    "Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?",
    "Don't rely on the strength of my image",
    "Is you goin' finished what you started, what you quittin' for?",
    "I'm more content with dark and stormier weather",
    "The city never lets me down!",
    "Deep inside my mind",
    "I hope you don't mind me, in the corner losing sleep",
    "Promise that you will sing about me",
    "Humble as a mumble in the jungle ya dig?",
