# Portfolio Site
My portfolio site. Made with React and React-Router, largely inspired by early 2000's web design such as in older anime and video game forums. 

## Dev Thoughts
A fun little endeavour in incorporating older web design aesthetics using modern frontend techniques and technologies. It was an interesting exercise having to replicate a deprecated HTML element like the marquee with React hooks and CSS animations, but overall I'm pleased with how the site turned out. Will probably come back at some point to make my own custom background and portrait image and every so often to update the music rotation visual and art gallery.

## Credits
A good chunk of the assets for the project were made by me, but the following were taken from other sources 
* The [background image of a starry night](https://www.tumblr.com/pleeping/47045018500) is from a post by tumblr user pleeping
* The portrait on my About Me section was made in a [Picrew](https://picrew.me/en/image_maker/1322863) made by tumblr user pepperjackets.
* The design of the music rotation visuals on the Interests page is inspired by [Topsters](https://topsters.org/), a popular music sharing format online. Images used for the topsters were pulled from a combination of [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/), a music cataloging site, and [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) a music streaming site.
* A [stamp of Futaba from Persona 5's All Out Attack animation](https://www.tumblr.com/dizzy-lights/724850595343876096/i-promised-so-i-shall-deliver-the-other-phantom) was made by tumblr user dizzy-lights.
